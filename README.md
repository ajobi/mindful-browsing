# Mindful Browsing

Mindful Browsing saves your time and increases your productivity by interrupting your mindless browsing habits.

Mindful Browsing is a productivity extension for Google Chrome that helps you stay focused on your task by targeting your mindless browsing habits. It offers a flexible policy that does not strictly forbid any content, but instead gives YOU the power over your browsing choices. You can still visit distracting websites after completing a small challenge, and if you really take the effort to do so, you are getting notified by the extension in a regular interval until all of the distracting content gets closed. Pleasant design, productivity quotes, or ability to specify your upcoming task are just a few of the convenience features you will have access to. Everything is for free and highly customizable.
